# Pipelane

> **Pipelane** is the repo-native release cockpit for AI-first builders.

`pipelane` is a standalone npm package for deterministic task workspaces, PR handoff,
merge discipline, deploy flow, and cleanup. It is meant for repos where Claude, Codex,
or both are doing a meaningful amount of the day-to-day operating.

The short version:

- product repos keep a small tracked workflow contract
- humans and AI both use the same repo-native commands
- task work happens in explicit git worktrees
- build mode and release mode are separate, deliberate lanes
- release state stays legible instead of living in tribal knowledge

## What Pipelane Actually Is

Pipelane is not:

- an AI model
- a hosted SaaS control plane
- a project management board
- a replacement for your editor, CI provider, or deployment platform

Pipelane is:

- a shared workflow engine that lives outside any one product repo
- a repo-local contract that gets installed into product repos
- a thin command layer that Claude and Codex can follow without improvising
- a release workflow that is stricter than "just merge and hope"

In a pipelane-enabled repo, the normal source of truth is the repo-native command surface:

```bash
npm run pipelane:devmode -- ...
npm run pipelane:new -- --task "task name"
npm run pipelane:pr -- --title "PR title"
npm run pipelane:merge
npm run pipelane:deploy -- staging
npm run pipelane:deploy -- prod
npm run pipelane:clean
```

Claude command files and Codex skills exist to make those commands easier to invoke, not to replace them.

## Why It Lives Outside Product Repos

Pipelane is intentionally its own repo.

That split keeps the boundary clean:

- product repos own product code, repo defaults, and deploy specifics
- Pipelane owns the reusable workflow engine, templates, and docs

Without that separation, product repos accumulate half-generic workflow logic, stale prompts,
and local setup instructions that are hard to reuse safely.

## What You Get In A Pipelane-Enabled Repo

Bootstrapping Pipelane into a repo adds or manages:

- tracked workflow config in `.pipelane.json`, or `.project-workflow.json` if you
  want a tool-neutral filename
- `.claude/commands/*` for repo-tracked Claude commands
- `.agents/skills/*` for repo-tracked Codex skills
- `pipelane/CLAUDE.template.md` for machine-local operator config
- `docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` for the repo's operator guide
- a Pipelane section in `README.md`
- a Pipelane section in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- canonical `npm run pipelane:*` scripts in `package.json`
- machine-local `CLAUDE.md` when the local operator runs setup

## The Pipelane Website / Board

Pipelane ships a local web UI called the **Pipelane Board**.

This is the "Pipelane website" most users will interact with. It is not a hosted control panel.
It is a local operator cockpit that reads the repo's `pipelane:api` snapshot and gives you a
visual view of the workflow state.

Use it for:

- seeing repo-wide attention items first
- scanning the current branch pipeline at a glance
- inspecting a branch's lane, history, and changed files
- running preflighted workflow actions from a visual interface
- keeping a local branch/release cockpit open while you work

It is not:

- the workflow source of truth
- a replacement for git or GitHub
- a planning board for product tasks
- a hosted dashboard for your whole team

In a pipelane-enabled consumer repo, the normal entry point is:

```bash
npm run pipelane:board
```

When working on the Pipelane package itself, you can point the dashboard at another repo:

```bash
npm run dashboard -- --repo /absolute/path/to/your/repo
```

The board shows:

- `Attention` and repo-wide release context first
- a `?` help guide for the build and release slash-command journeys
- one active pipeline card per branch
- lane reasons and status history
- row actions and board-level actions
- lazy patch previews and execution feedback

Local board settings live at:

```text
~/.pipelane/dashboard/<repo>-<hash>.json
```

- [Pipelane API contract](docs/public/PIPELANE_API.md)

## Requirements

Pipelane does not require a giant platform dependency stack, but it is not literally zero-dependency.
If you want the full workflow to work end to end, you need to understand the prerequisites clearly.

### Hard requirements for installation

- Node.js `>=22.0.0`
- npm
- filesystem access to the target repo

### Hard requirements for normal day-to-day workflow

- git installed
- a target repo on disk
- a real base branch, usually `main`
- at least one commit on that base branch before you start creating task worktrees
- an `origin` remote with the base branch pushed if you want the default safe `/new` flow

Why the remote matters:

- `/new` branches from `origin/<base-branch>` by default, not from a guessed local state
- if `origin/main` cannot be refreshed, `/new` fails closed and tells you to rerun with `--offline`

### Hard requirements for PR, merge, and deploy flow

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated for the target repo

Why:

- `pipelane:pr` pushes to `origin` and creates or edits a PR through `gh`
- `pipelane:merge` merges the PR through `gh`
- `pipelane:deploy` dispatches and tracks deploy workflow activity through `gh`

### Optional environment integrations

- Claude Code if you want repo-tracked `.claude/commands/*`
- Codex if you want repo-tracked Codex skills

### Release-mode-only requirements

- each release operator must have a local `CLAUDE.md`
- that local `CLAUDE.md` must include valid staging and production deploy config
- `npm run pipelane:release-check` must pass before release mode is considered ready
- if `healthcheckUrl` changes, rerun `npm run pipelane:doctor -- --probe` because cached probe results are URL-bound

### What "Works Out Of The Box" Means In Practice

`bootstrap` can scaffold an empty directory and install the repo-local dependency. That part works.

What does **not** work automatically unless the repo is actually ready:

- `/new` in a non-git directory
- `/new` in a git repo with no commits
- `/new` in a repo with no `origin` remote unless you intentionally use `--offline`
- `/pr`, `/merge`, or `/deploy` without a working GitHub CLI setup
- release mode without local deploy configuration

That fail-closed behavior is intentional. Pipelane favors explicit requirements over silent guesses.

## Detailed Install Journey

This section is the exact user journey for adopting Pipelane in a repo.

### Step 1: Start From A Repo That Is Actually Ready

If you already have a remote-backed git repo with a base branch and at least one commit, use that.

If you are starting from scratch, do this first:

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
git init -b main
npm init -y
git add package.json
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:you/my-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

Pipelane can scaffold before this point, but the normal task workflow starts making sense only after
the repo has a real git base to branch from.

### Step 2: Bootstrap Pipelane Into The Repo

Inside the target repo:

```bash
npx -y pipelane@github:jokim1/pipelane#main bootstrap --project "My App"
```

If `pipelane` is already on your `PATH`, the equivalent is:

```bash
pipelane bootstrap --project "My App"
```

What `bootstrap` does:

1. installs the repo-local `pipelane` dependency if needed
2. runs `pipelane init`
3. runs `pipelane setup`
4. creates local `CLAUDE.md` if it does not exist yet
5. writes tracked Codex skills under `.agents/skills/*`
6. prints readiness warnings if the repo is not actually ready for `/new`

### Step 3: Review What Bootstrap Added

After bootstrap, you should expect to see:

- `.pipelane.json`
- `.claude/commands/*`
- `.agents/skills/*`
- `pipelane/CLAUDE.template.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md`
- Pipelane sections in `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `pipelane:*` scripts in `package.json`
- local `CLAUDE.md`

If you want the repo to stay tool-neutral, rename `.pipelane.json` to
`.project-workflow.json` before committing. Pipelane `main` reads either
filename as of April 21, 2026 (merge commit `4111230`, PR #44). No shim is
required on that build.

### Step 4: Commit The Tracked Pipelane Files

Do this before using `/new` in a normal remote-backed repo:

```bash
git add .pipelane.json .claude/commands .agents/skills README.md CONTRIBUTING.md docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md pipelane/CLAUDE.template.md package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add pipelane workflow"
git push
```

If you renamed the config to `.project-workflow.json`, add that file instead:

```bash
git add .project-workflow.json .claude/commands .agents/skills README.md CONTRIBUTING.md docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md pipelane/CLAUDE.template.md package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add pipelane workflow"
git push
```

Why this matters:

- `/new` creates task worktrees from the repo's base branch
- if the base branch does not contain the tracked Pipelane files yet, new task worktrees will not inherit the workflow contract

### Step 5: Each User Finishes Their Local Setup

#### Every Claude user

1. pull the repo after the tracked files are committed
2. optionally run `pipelane install-claude` once per machine if they want the global `/init-pipelane` bootstrap command
3. open the repo in Claude Code
4. reopen Claude if it was already open before the repo gained Pipelane files or aliases changed

#### Every Codex user

1. pull the repo after the tracked files are committed
2. optionally run `pipelane install-codex` once per machine if they want the global `/init-pipelane` bootstrap command
3. if this machine previously used pipelane's machine-local Codex wrappers, run `npm run pipelane:setup` once to prune them
4. open the repo in Codex
5. reopen Codex if it was already open before the repo gained tracked skills or aliases changed

### Do users need a shim?

Usually, no.

- If the repo tracks `.pipelane.json`, no shim is needed.
- If the repo tracks `.project-workflow.json` and your local pipelane build includes
  PR #44 / merge commit `4111230` on `main` from April 21, 2026, no shim is needed.
- If someone is on an older local pipelane install from before that change, they
  must upgrade pipelane or temporarily create a local `.pipelane.json` shim that
  points at `.project-workflow.json`.

## Detailed User Journey: Build Mode

Build mode is the fast lane. Use it when you want the shortest path from merge to production and you
do not need a required staging promotion step for the same SHA.

### Build mode requirements

Before starting a build-mode task, make sure:

- the repo is already bootstrapped with Pipelane
- the tracked Pipelane files are committed on the base branch
- your local machine has already run `npm run pipelane:setup`
- the repo has a working `origin` remote unless you intentionally plan to use `--offline`
- `gh` is installed and authenticated if you plan to use `/pr` and `/merge`

### Step 1: Confirm Or Switch To Build Mode

Slash command:

```text
/devmode build
```

Repo-native equivalent:

```bash
npm run pipelane:devmode -- build
```

What this does:

- records that the repo is currently operating in the fast lane
- tells later commands that production deploy is the normal post-merge path
- removes the release-lane staging requirement for this task flow

### Step 2: Create A Task Workspace

Slash command:

```text
/new my-task
```

Repo-native equivalent:

```bash
npm run pipelane:new -- --task "my-task"
```

What this does:

- refreshes `origin/<base-branch>` by default
- creates a new `codex/<task>-<hex>` branch
- creates a separate git worktree for the task
- records the task lock so the repo can recover it later with `/resume`

Important:

- if the repo has no `origin` remote, this step fails closed by default
- if you knowingly want to branch from local `main`, rerun with `--offline`

### Step 3: Implement And Verify

Do the actual work inside the task worktree.

Before opening the PR, make sure the repo's configured pre-PR checks are healthy. By default those are:

- `npm run test`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`

The exact checks come from `.pipelane.json`.

### Step 4: Open Or Update The PR

Slash command:

```text
/pr
```

Repo-native equivalent:

```bash
npm run pipelane:pr -- --title "Add feature X"
```

What this does:

- runs the configured pre-PR checks
- stages and commits dirty changes if needed
- pushes the branch to `origin`
- creates or updates the pull request through `gh`
- records the PR state for later merge and deploy flow

If the worktree is dirty and this is a brand-new PR, pass `--title`.

### Step 5: Merge The PR

Slash command:

```text
/merge
```

Repo-native equivalent:

```bash
npm run pipelane:merge
```

What this does:

- waits for PR checks
- merges through `gh`
- records the merged SHA
- in build mode, may dispatch production deploy immediately if the repo config has auto-deploy-on-merge enabled

### Step 6: Verify Production

Two cases exist in build mode:

- if the repo auto-deploys on merge, verify that production is healthy
- if the repo does not auto-deploy on merge, deploy manually:

```bash
npm run pipelane:deploy -- prod
```

Then verify the production result.

### Step 7: Clean Up

Slash command:

```text
/clean
```

Repo-native equivalent:

```bash
npm run pipelane:clean
```

Use this after production is verified and the task is truly done.

## Detailed User Journey: Release Mode

Release mode is the protected lane. Use it when you want the merged SHA promoted through staging and
then production in order, with a fail-closed gate around release readiness.

### Release mode requirements

Before starting a release-mode task, make sure:

- everything in the build-mode requirements is already true
- local `CLAUDE.md` has valid staging and production deploy configuration
- `npm run pipelane:release-check` passes

Release mode is intentionally stricter than build mode.

### Step 0: Prepare Release Operator Configuration

If you have not done it on this machine yet:

```bash
npm run pipelane:setup
```

Then open local `CLAUDE.md`, fill in the deploy configuration block, and verify readiness:

```bash
npm run pipelane:release-check
```

Until this is configured correctly, release mode stays fail-closed.
If the staging URL or healthcheck path changes later, rerun
`npm run pipelane:doctor -- --probe` so the cached probe result matches
the new target. If you enable `PIPELANE_PROBE_STATE_KEY`, rerun the
probe after setting it so readiness is backed by signed probe records.

### Step 1: Confirm Or Switch To Release Mode

Slash command:

```text
/devmode release
```

Repo-native equivalent:

```bash
npm run pipelane:devmode -- release
```

What this does:

- records that the repo is now using the protected lane
- enforces release readiness instead of assuming it
- makes staging promotion part of the normal path

### Step 2: Create A Task Workspace

Use the same task-start flow as build mode:

```bash
npm run pipelane:new -- --task "my-task"
```

This still expects a valid git base and usually an `origin` remote.

### Step 3: Implement And Verify

Do the work in the task worktree and make sure the configured checks pass before PR creation.

### Step 4: Open Or Update The PR

```bash
npm run pipelane:pr -- --title "Add feature X"
```

In release mode, PR creation also checks that release readiness is satisfied unless an explicit
override has been recorded.

### Step 5: Merge The PR

```bash
npm run pipelane:merge
```

After merge, Pipelane records the merged SHA and expects the next step to be staging promotion.

### Step 6: Deploy That Merged SHA To Staging

Slash command:

```text
/deploy staging
```

Repo-native equivalent:

```bash
npm run pipelane:deploy -- staging
```

What this does:

- resolves the merged SHA for the task
- dispatches the deploy workflow
- records staging deploy state
- expects the staging verification to succeed before prod is allowed

### Step 7: Verify Staging

Do not skip this. In release mode, the entire point is that staging validates the same merged SHA
before production.

### Step 8: Promote The Same SHA To Production

Slash command:

```text
/deploy prod
```

Repo-native equivalent:

```bash
npm run pipelane:deploy -- prod
```

Prod deploy is blocked unless Pipelane can prove there is a qualifying staging success for the same
task, same SHA, and same surfaces.

### Step 9: Verify Production

Confirm that the production deployment is healthy and complete.

### Step 10: Clean Up

```bash
npm run pipelane:clean
```

Run cleanup only after the release is truly complete.

## Alias Configuration

The default slash aliases are:

- `/devmode`
- `/new`
- `/resume`
- `/pr`
- `/merge`
- `/deploy`
- `/clean`
- `/status`
- `/doctor`
- `/rollback`

Those names come from `.pipelane.json` under `aliases`.

If you change aliases:

- rerun `npm run pipelane:setup`
- commit the regenerated `.claude/commands/*` and `.agents/skills/*`
- reopen Claude or Codex if it was already open
- keep aliases unique

Pipelane fails closed if an alias would overwrite an unrelated Claude command or Codex skill.

## Command Reference

- `/pipelane`: show the build/release journey overview
- `/pipelane web`: open the local Pipelane Board
- `/devmode`: inspect or switch between `build` and `release`
- `/new`: create a fresh isolated task workspace
- `/resume`: recover an existing task workspace
- `/repo-guard`: verify the checkout is safe for task work
- `/pr`: run checks, push, and create or update a PR

Canonical repo-native commands:

- `npm run pipelane:setup`
- `npm run pipelane:configure`
- `npm run pipelane:devmode -- ...`
- `npm run pipelane:new -- --task "<task-name>"`
- `npm run pipelane:resume -- --task "<task-name>"`
- `npm run pipelane:repo-guard`
- `npm run pipelane:pr -- ...`

## Use Pipelane With Gstack

You should generally use both.

The boundary is:

- `pipelane` owns repo-specific task workspaces, PR/merge/deploy flow, and release discipline
- gstack remains useful for generic planning, review, QA, investigation, documentation, and broader AI workflows

If a repo uses Pipelane, prefer the Pipelane release flow over generic gstack `/ship`.

## Workflow

This repo uses `pipelane`, the repo-specific workflow layer for AI-first builders.

It is designed to work well with Claude, Codex, and similar tools by keeping the release flow
deterministic:

- repo-native commands are the source of truth
- slash commands are thin adapters
- `/new` creates explicit isolated task workspaces
- `/resume` recovers them later when needed

The default alias set can be changed in `.pipelane.json`. If aliases change, rerun
`npm run pipelane:setup` and reopen Claude/Codex so the new names are picked up.
Aliases must be unique, and setup fails closed if an alias would overwrite an unrelated command.
Codex resolves aliases per repo at runtime, so the same alias can mean different workflow commands in different pipelane repos on one machine.

### Two dev modes

`pipelane` gives this repo two lanes:

- `build`: the fast lane, where merge is expected to hand off production deploy
- `release`: the protected lane, where staging happens before prod for the same merged SHA

### Build mode user journey

User-facing:

1. `/devmode build`
2. `/new <task-name>`
3. `/pr`
4. `/merge`
5. `/clean`

Repo-native:

```bash
npm run pipelane:devmode -- build
npm run pipelane:new -- --task "example-task"
npm run pipelane:pr -- --title "Example PR title"
npm run pipelane:merge
npm run pipelane:clean
```

### Release mode user journey

User-facing:

1. `/devmode release`
2. `/new <task-name>`
3. `/pr`
4. `/merge`
5. `/deploy staging`
6. `/smoke staging`
7. `/deploy prod`
7. `/clean`

Repo-native:

```bash
npm run pipelane:devmode -- release
npm run pipelane:new -- --task "example-task"
npm run pipelane:pr -- --title "Example PR title"
npm run pipelane:merge
npm run pipelane:deploy -- staging
npm run pipelane:smoke -- staging
npm run pipelane:deploy -- prod
npm run pipelane:clean
```

### Command surface

- `/pipelane` (journey overview)
- `/pipelane web` (local web board)
- `/devmode`
- `/new`
- `/resume`
- `/pr`
- `/merge`
- `/deploy`
- `/smoke`
- `/clean`
- `/status`
- `/doctor`
- `/rollback`

Canonical repo-native commands:

- `npm run pipelane:setup`
- `npm run pipelane:devmode -- ...`
- `npm run pipelane:new -- --task "<task-name>"` (the `--task` flag is optional; omitting it generates a `task-<hex>` slug)
- `npm run pipelane:resume -- --task "<task-name>"`
- `npm run pipelane:pr -- ...`
- `npm run pipelane:merge`
- `npm run pipelane:release-check`
- `npm run pipelane:task-lock -- verify --task "<task-name>"`
- `npm run pipelane:deploy -- staging|prod ...`
- `npm run pipelane:smoke -- plan|staging|prod`
- `npm run pipelane:clean`
- `npm run pipelane:status`
- `npm run pipelane:doctor` (add `-- --probe` for live healthchecks, `-- --fix` for the guided wizard)
- `npm run pipelane:board`
- `npm run pipelane:update`

### pipelane + gstack

Use both.

- use `pipelane` for task workspaces, PR prep, merge, and deploy flow
- use gstack for review, QA, architecture review, deploy bootstrap, docs, and investigation

If this repo is adopting pipelane for the first time, commit the tracked Pipelane files
before using `pipelane:new` in a remote-backed repo.

### What each user still needs to do

- One repo maintainer runs `pipelane bootstrap --project "<name>"`, reviews `.pipelane.json`, and commits the tracked Pipelane files.
- Each Claude user can run `pipelane install-claude` once per machine for the global `/init-pipelane` bootstrap command, then pulls the repo and reopens Claude if command files or aliases changed.
- Each Codex user can optionally run `pipelane install-codex` once per machine for the global `/init-pipelane` bootstrap command, then pulls the repo. If that machine previously used pipelane's machine-local Codex wrappers, rerun `npm run pipelane:setup` once to prune them before reopening Codex.
- Each release operator fills local deploy config in `CLAUDE.md` and verifies with `npm run pipelane:release-check`.

Use [docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md](./docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md) for the full operator workflow.
