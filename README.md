`pipelane` is a standalone workflow package for repo-native release management.

It is the repo-specific workflow layer that sits underneath your AI tools. Product repos keep a
small tracked workflow contract, local prompts, and thin slash-command adapters. The operator
logic itself lives here, versioned once.

## Why Pipelane exists

AI-assisted coding is fast. That is the good news and the problem.

If you are a solo builder or a small team using Claude, Codex, or both as your primary operator
layer, you need a workflow that is easy for an AI to follow without improvising unsafe repo
behavior. You want deterministic commands, explicit task workspaces, recoverable state, and a
release flow that is more disciplined than "just ship it."

That is what Pipelane is for.

It gives every repo the same reliable shape:

- repo-native commands as the source of truth
- thin slash adapters for Claude and Codex
- explicit task workspace creation and recovery
- machine-local operator state in `CLAUDE.md`
- a documented split between fast build-mode shipping and protected release-mode promotion
- a local Pipelane Board dashboard for visual pipeline status (`/pipelane`)

## Why it lives outside product repos

Pipelane is intentionally a separate repo.

That keeps a clean boundary:

- product repos own product code and repo-specific defaults
- Pipelane owns the shared workflow engine, templates, and docs

Without that split, product repos get muddy fast. It becomes unclear which logic is generic,
which is project-specific, and which instructions are safe to carry forward into the next repo.

## Optimized for AI-first builders

This package is designed for AI-first solo builders and small teams. If you are "vibe coding"
with a strong AI operator in the loop, the workflow needs to reduce ambiguity instead of adding
more.

The design choices are deliberate:

- Repo-native commands are the source of truth. The AI can always fall back to `npm run workflow:*`.
- Slash commands are thin adapters. Claude and Codex do not own the workflow logic.
- Task workspaces are explicit and recoverable. `/new` creates a fresh isolated branch/worktree. `/resume` recovers it later.
- `CLAUDE.md` stays local-only. Machine-specific deploy state does not leak into tracked repo policy.
- Build and release are separate lanes. Fast shipping and protected promotion are both first-class, instead of being mashed together.

This is not about making the workflow fancy. It is about making it legible enough that an AI can
follow it safely and a human can predict what will happen next.

## What it gives you

- repo-native workflow commands
- a canonical task workspace flow with `/new` and `/resume`
- local operator bootstrap via `CLAUDE.md`
- tracked Claude command files
- generic Codex slash wrappers
- a reusable release workflow doc for new maintainers
- a local Pipelane Board reference dashboard for workflow-aware repos

## Pipelane Board

`workflow-kit` ships a local reference dashboard — the **Pipelane Board** — for repos that expose
a public `workflow:api` surface.

Run it against a target repo:

```bash
npm run dashboard -- --repo /absolute/path/to/your/repo
```

What it is:

- a development dashboard reference design, not the workflow source of truth
- a thin local adapter over the repo's CLI JSON contract
- an opinionated branch-operations cockpit for triage, deploy handoff, cleanup, and follow-through

What it shows:

- `Attention` and repo-wide release context first
- a kanban-like branch ledger with one active pipeline card per branch
- branch detail with lane reasons, history, row actions, changed files, and lazy patch previews
- action feedback and execution streaming for preflighted workflow actions

Local settings are stored per repo in:

```text
~/.workflow-kit/dashboard/<repo>-<hash>.json
```

Use the board's Settings button to customize:

- board name
- board subtitle
- preferred port for future launches
- auto-refresh interval

- [Dashboard implementation guide](src/dashboard/README.md)

## Two dev modes

`workflow-kit` has two lanes.

### Build mode

Build mode is the fast lane.

Use it when:

- you want the shortest path from merge to production
- you do not need same-SHA staging promotion
- the repo or project is early enough that speed matters more than staged rollout discipline

In build mode:

- `/merge` is expected to hand off production deploy
- there is no required staging step
- `/deploy prod` is mainly for manual redeploy or recovery

### Release mode

Release mode is the protected lane.

Use it when:

- you need staged validation before prod
- backend or multi-surface coordination matters
- you want the merged SHA promoted through staging and then production in order

In release mode:

- `/devmode release` is fail-closed
- local `CLAUDE.md` must define valid staging and production config
- `/deploy staging` must happen before `/deploy prod` for the same merged SHA

## User journey: build mode

When you want the fastest operator path, the user-facing journey is:

1. `/devmode build`
2. `/new <task-name>`
3. implement and verify
4. `/pr`
5. `/merge`
6. verify production
7. `/clean`

The repo-native equivalents are:

```bash
npm run workflow:devmode -- build
npm run workflow:new -- --task "task name"
npm run workflow:pr -- --title "PR title"
npm run workflow:merge
npm run workflow:clean
```

Choose build mode when you want the repo to optimize for speed and a short handoff from merge to
production. 

Once you've set /devmode to build, you don't need to set it again. Once you need production stability,
switch to release mode. Only set devmode back to build if you want to come back later.

## User journey: release mode

When you want a protected staged release path, the user-facing journey is:

1. `/devmode release`
2. `/new <task-name>`
3. implement and verify
4. `/pr`
5. `/merge`
6. `/deploy staging`
7. verify staging
8. `/deploy prod`
9. verify production
10. `/clean`

The repo-native equivalents are:

```bash
npm run workflow:devmode -- release
npm run workflow:new -- --task "task name"
npm run workflow:pr -- --title "PR title"
npm run workflow:merge
npm run workflow:deploy -- staging
npm run workflow:deploy -- prod
npm run workflow:clean
```

Choose release mode when the repo needs explicit same-SHA staged promotion and a stricter release
gate.

## Command reference

- `/devmode`: inspect or switch between `build` and `release`.
- `/new`: create a fresh isolated task workspace on a new `codex/<task>-<4hex>` branch. The `<task-name>` argument is optional — when omitted, a `task-<hex>` slug is generated automatically so you can spin up an isolated worktree without naming the task up front.
- `/resume`: recover an existing task workspace by task name when you come back later.
- `/pr`: verify, stage, commit, push, and create or update the current task PR.
- `/merge`: merge the task PR and record the merged SHA for later deploy flow.
- `/deploy`: deploy the merged SHA to `staging` or `prod`.
- `/clean`: inspect workflow state and prune stale task locks when requested.

Canonical repo-native commands:

- `npm run workflow:setup`
- `npm run workflow:devmode -- ...`
- `npm run workflow:new -- --task "<task-name>"`
- `npm run workflow:resume -- --task "<task-name>"`
- `npm run workflow:pr -- ...`
- `npm run workflow:merge`
- `npm run workflow:release-check`
- `npm run workflow:task-lock -- verify --task "<task-name>"`
- `npm run workflow:deploy -- staging|prod ...`
- `npm run workflow:clean`

## Use workflow-kit with gstack

You should use both.

`workflow-kit` is not a replacement for gstack. It is the repo-specific workflow layer that works
well alongside gstack.

The boundary is:

- `workflow-kit` owns repo-specific release discipline, task workspaces, and deterministic repo-native commands
- gstack remains recommended for generic higher-level workflows like `review`, `qa`, `plan-eng-review`, `setup-deploy`, documentation, investigation, and standalone Codex workflows

If a repo uses `workflow-kit`, prefer the workflow-kit release flow over generic gstack `/ship`.
That is the key distinction. `/ship` is strong generic automation. `workflow-kit` is the
repo-specific release contract.

The "best of both worlds" loop looks like this:

1. use gstack to plan, review, test, or investigate
2. use `workflow-kit` to start the task workspace with `/new`
3. use `workflow-kit` to prep the PR, merge, and deploy
4. go back to gstack for QA, docs, or follow-up review

That pairing is the recommended setup.

## Install into a new repo

Inside a target repo:

```bash
npm install -D /Users/josephkim/dev/workflow-kit
npx workflow-kit init --project "Next Project"
npm run workflow:setup
```

That adds:

- `.project-workflow.json`
- `.claude/commands/*`
- `workflow/CLAUDE.template.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md`
- workflow sections in `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- canonical `package.json` workflow scripts

## First adoption caveat

Important for first adoption in an existing remote-backed repo:

- run `workflow-kit init`
- review the tracked files
- commit them before using `workflow:new`

`workflow:new` creates new task worktrees from the repo's base branch. The tracked workflow
contract needs to exist there first.
