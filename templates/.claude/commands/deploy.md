<!-- workflow-kit:command:deploy -->
Deploy the merged SHA for this repo.

Run:

```bash
npm run workflow:deploy -- $ARGUMENTS
```

Expected arguments:

- `staging [surfaces...]`
- `prod [surfaces...]`

Release mode requires staging before production for the same merged SHA and surface set.

Production deploys in release mode require typed-SHA-prefix confirmation. The operator
prompts for the first 4 characters of the target SHA before dispatching; surface the
prompt to the human rather than auto-answering. For scripted or CI prod deploys, drive
the deploy through `pipelane run api action deploy.prod --execute --confirm-token <t>`
using the token issued by a prior `api action deploy.prod` preflight.

Display the output directly. Report the environment, SHA, surfaces, and next step.
