<!-- pipelane:command:smoke -->
Plan smoke coverage, configure the smoke runner, or run deterministic smoke against staging or prod.

Run:

```bash
npm run pipelane:smoke -- $ARGUMENTS
```

Expected subcommands:

- _no subcommand_ — lists registered smoke checks (from `.pipelane/smoke-checks.json`), discovered `@smoke-*` tags not yet registered, candidate test files without `@smoke` tags, and the currently configured runner command. If no checks are registered, it prints a guided empty state with `Y`/`1`/`2`/`3` options and JSON `emptyState` metadata.
- `plan` — scaffolds or audits `.pipelane/smoke-checks.json` and prints the top actions.
- `setup` — wires a smoke runner command into `.pipelane.json`. See "Setup quoting" below for passing commands with spaces / metacharacters.
- `staging` — runs smoke for the currently deployed staging SHA.
- `prod` — runs the prod-safe smoke subset for the currently deployed prod SHA.
- `waiver` / `quarantine` / `unquarantine` — coverage-registry management.

Rules:

- `staging` / `prod` inject `PIPELANE_SMOKE_ENV`, `PIPELANE_SMOKE_BASE_URL`, `PIPELANE_SMOKE_SHA`, and `PIPELANE_SMOKE_RUN_ID` into the repo-owned smoke command.
- `setup` is two-mode: either **auto-wired** (exactly one strong candidate package script, or explicit `--staging-command`) or **needs input** (multiple candidates, weak-only, or no candidates — setup writes nothing and tells you which flag to pass).
- `setup` refuses to promote a release gate it cannot run: `--require-staging-smoke=true` plus no staging command is treated as misconfigured and exits 1.
- `setup` exit codes: 0 for `configured` / `already configured` / `needs input`; 1 for `misconfigured` or write failures.

## Setup input forms

For the common case — picking a package.json script — use the **script form**. No quoting, no `npm run` prefix, no shell-escape gotchas:

- `/smoke setup --staging-script=test:e2e:smoke` → writes `smoke.staging.command = "npm run test:e2e:smoke"`.
- `/smoke setup --prod-script=test:e2e:smoke:prod` → writes `smoke.prod.command = "npm run test:e2e:smoke:prod"`.

For non-Node repos or custom invocations, use the **command form**:

- **Claude slash command:** `/smoke setup --staging-command="make smoke"` (single quotes also work).
- **Codex skill:** same double-quoted form.
- **npm script:** `npm run pipelane:smoke -- setup --staging-command="make smoke"` (note the `--` separator).
- **Bare CLI:** `pipelane run smoke setup --staging-command='pytest -k smoke --workers=2'` (single quotes when the value contains double quotes; avoid literal `@smoke-*` tag syntax in docs or smoke tag discovery will treat the doc itself as a test source).

Script and command forms are **mutually exclusive** — pass one or the other, not both.

Setup flags (accepted only on `smoke setup`):

- `--staging-script=<name>` — package.json script name; auto-prefixed to `npm run <name>`. Preferred when applicable.
- `--staging-command=<cmd>` — full shell command. Use when not a package script.
- `--prod-script=<name>` / `--prod-command=<cmd>` — same shape for production. Mutually exclusive with each other.
- `--require-staging-smoke=true|false` — release-gate switch; must pair with a staging script/command when true.
- `--generated-summary-path=<path>` — override the smoke summary output path.
- `--critical-path=<surface-or-path>` — repeatable; deduped, first-seen order preserved.
- `--critical-path-coverage=warn|block` — how /deploy prod treats uncovered critical paths.

Display the output directly and keep the environment explicit. If the output
prints "Choose the action to take:", ask the user to pick one of the printed
choices; do not reduce it to "rerun with --yes". When the user picks a runnable
choice, run the matching slash command.

## Guided empty states

Bare `/smoke` is intentionally read-only. When it returns an `emptyState`,
continue the conversation in chat instead of asking the user to memorize
commands.

Offer the exact choices from `emptyState.options`. Follow each option's
`intent` or `command`; do not assume the same number always means the same
action for every empty-state kind.

- If an option has `intent: "start_smoke_interview"`, start the interview.
- If an option has `command`, run or offer that command.
- If the selected option is manual tagging, explain how to tag existing tests,
  then run `/smoke plan` after tags are added.

For the smoke interview, ask one question at a time. The first question must be:

```text
What are the 1-3 user journeys that must work before this app is considered alive?
```

After the user answers, convert the answer into the deterministic setup path,
primarily:

```bash
/smoke setup --feedback "<answer>"
```

When the selected option runs setup, use `/smoke setup` so repo analysis can
generate baseline hot paths where supported.

When the selected option is manual tagging, explain that the user can add
`@smoke-<name>` tags to existing tests and then run `/smoke plan` to register
them.

## Runner results contract

A smoke runner communicates per-tag results by writing JSON to `$PIPELANE_SMOKE_RESULTS_PATH`:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "checks": [
    {
      "tag": "@smoke-<name>",
      "status": "passed",
      "tests": { "passed": 3, "total": 10 }
    }
  ]
}
```

Fields per check:

- `tag` — required; must match a registered smoke tag.
- `status` — required; `passed`, `failed`, or `passed_with_retries`.
- `attempts` — optional; array of per-retry `{ attempt, status }` entries.
- `artifacts` — optional; `{ firstFailureTrace, htmlReport, screenshotDir }`.
- `tests` — optional; `{ passed, total }` individual test case counts within the tag. When present, post-run summaries print `(N/M tests passed)` instead of a bare `(passed)`. Invalid shapes (non-number, `total === 0`, `passed > total`) are silently dropped.

Consumer runners (e.g. a Playwright reporter adapter) can opt in to `tests` at any time — older runners without the field continue to work unchanged.
